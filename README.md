# YallaKora-Web-Scraping
 I managed using 'BeautifulSoup' and 'requests' libraries to scrap Data about Football Leagues from YallaKora website
 seprating each league on it's own CSV file, i got the date, teams names, score, and status of the match
 i managed to collect from day 3/5/2024 to 12/5/2024
 any perioud can be selected and the code will automatically scrab the data and create 9 diffrent CSV files each one for a specific League
 the Leagues are:
 ['EGYPTIONLEAGUE', 'PREMIERLEAGUE','SPAINLEAGUE','SAUDILEAGUE','ITALILEAFGUE','GERMANLEAGUE','FRANCELEAGUE','TURKEYLEAGUE','PORTGALLEAGUE']
 The source code is available in a notebook, feel free to reach me for any questions
